# Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of text using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to determine whether a given piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of computationally determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project utilizes the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to assign a sentiment polarity score to the input text. The sentiment polarity score ranges from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive), with values close to 0 indicating a neutral sentiment.

## Features

- Analyze the sentiment of a given text input.
- Provide a sentiment polarity score indicating the strength and direction of sentiment.
- Determine sentiment labels as positive, negative, or neutral based on the polarity score.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The programming language used for implementing the sentiment analysis code.
- NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit library used for sentiment analysis using the VADER tool.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for running and testing the sentiment analysis code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook to analyze the sentiment of the provided text.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook and locate the input text section.
2. Replace the `input_text` variable with the text you want to analyze.
3. Run the code cells to see the sentiment polarity score and label for the input text.

## Example

For the input text: "I absolutely loved the movie. The acting was superb and the plot was intriguing."

Output:
```
Sentiment Polarity Score: 0.8779
Sentiment Label: Positive
```
